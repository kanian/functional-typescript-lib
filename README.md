# FUNCTIONAL TYPESCRIPT LIB
This library is a set of typescript functional tools.

To install:
  ```
  npm install functional-typescript-lib
  ```

The aim is to make the code as clear as possible. 

The library has a number of usable algebraic types, such as:
* Maybe
* Either

It also has a number of essential functions such as:
* compose
* curry
* pipe
* map

Moreover, it has examples of how to build common algebraic types such as:
* Functors
* Applicatives
* Monads

Good reference materials to understand what is going on here are:
*Professor Firsby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming*
