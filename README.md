# FUNCTIONAL TYPESCRIPT LIB
A set of typescript functional tools built as an execise in typescript functional programming
  ```npm install functional-typescript-lib```
The aim is to make the code as clear as possible, as such there is no optimization. This is really more like a notebook, or a 'bestiary'.
A good reference material to understand what is going on here is:
*Professor Firsby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming*
